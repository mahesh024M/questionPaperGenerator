2) Extract the files and open the files with IDE like vscode.

6)This gives output and the output is also written in a file name generated_questions.json 

*Some common errors you get and how to handle them:
1)The given default port is 7000 and if the port already has another application, it may give an error.
  So change the port number.
2)If there are any no module errors, install the required modules using npm install <module-name> 


*If we have more data in node_modules, we can use the .gitignore file.
